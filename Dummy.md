## What is a Recommendation System?
A recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing '_system_' with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "_rating_" or "_preference_" a user would give to an item- _Wikipedia_

## Which are some big companies that use Recommender Systems?
* Google
* Youtube
* Facebook
* Netflix
* Spotify
* Amazon
* Reddit
* HackerNews

## Personalized and Non-Personalized Recommendation Systems:
### 1. Personalized Recommendation System-
 * Based on user behavior like purchases
 * Page Views
 * Items added to the cart together

### 2. Non-Personalized Recommendation Systems-

   * Displays the products that are popular among the people in general during that time frame.

## Recommendation can be based on:

### 1. Popularity
* More Buying - More Money
* Eg. Highest Grossing Movies: Avatar, Tianic, etc. People are willing to pay money to watch these movies.

### 2. Popularity Issues
* If I go for a vacation in a new city and I get recommendation of McDonald's which is the most popular resturant.
* I might not like McDonald's as an option, as I would love to try the local food in the given area

## Recommendation Based on Association:

## Example
If I buy an Iphone XR, I get recommendations of of buying an Iphone charger, case, etc.

Another simple approch is being aware of products which are being **bought together** or **the things that go together**.

## How does this work?
### Approach- Apriori algorithm

Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database - _Wikipedia_
