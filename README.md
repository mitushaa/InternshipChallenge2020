# Recommender System using Python 
 ## **My Project Description:**
 The goal of my project is to show the capabilities of a Recommendation System.<br>
  
   I'll be introducing following things:
1. Recommendation System Using collaborative filtering 
2. Recommendation System Using Content Based System
3. Recommendation System Using Hybrid Recommender
4. Context Aware Recommender System

## Types of Recommender Systems:

## 1. Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems
 ### **User-Based collaborative filtering**- <br> 
   * In user-based collaborative filtering, recommendations are generated by considering the preferences in the user's
   neighborhood. 
   * User-based collaborative filtering is done in two steps:
   * Identify similar users based on similar user preferences.
   * Recommend new items to an active user based on the rating given by similar users on the items not rated by the active user.
 ### **Item-Based collaborative filtering**- <br>
   * In item-based collaborative filtering, the recommendations are generated using the neighbourhood of items.<br>
   * Unlike user-based collaborative filtering, we first find similarities between items and then recommend non-rated items which are        similar to the items the active user has rated in past. 
   * Item-based recommender systems are constructed in two steps:<br>
   * Calculate the item similarity based on the item preferences.
   * Find the top similar items to the non-rated items by active user and recommend them.
 ## 2. Content-Based Recommender Systems
   * A content-based recommender system uses the content information of the items for building the recommendation model.<br>
   * A content recommender system typically contains a user-profile generation step, item profile generation step and model building step to generate recommendations for an active user. 
   * The content-based recommender system recommends items to users by taking the content or features of items and user profiles. 
   * **Example-** If you have searched for videos of Car Racing on YouTube, then the content-based recommender system will learn your preference and recommend other videos related to Car Racing and other videos related to racing.
 ## 3. Hybrid Recommender System
   *  This type of recommendation engine is built by combining various recommender systems to build a more robust system. By combining various recommender systems, we can replace the disadvantages of one system with the advantages of
another system and thus build a more robust system. 
   * For example, by combining collaborative filtering methods, where the model fails when new items don't have ratings, with content-based systems, where feature information about the items is available, new items can be recommended more accurately and efficiently.

## Personalization level of Recommender System:
Recommendations can come at many personalization levels, from using basic statistics
to looking at individual user data.

 
 ### 1. Non-Personalized Recommender Sytem:<br>
  *  __Non-personalized__ recommender system displays the products that are popular among the people in general during that time frame.
   
 ### 2. Personalized Recommender System:<br>
  * __Personalized__ recommender system is based on data about the current user that indicates how the user has interacted with the system previously. This generates recommendations specifically for this user.

 ### 3. Semi-Personalized Recommender System:<br>
 * __Semi-Personalized__ recommender system doesnâ€™t know anything personal about you, only you as
a member of a group or segment. Other people who fit into the same group will get
the same recommendations.

## Implementation of Recommendation System
This is how I first started ðŸ˜ƒ
### 1.  Building the Basic Recommendation System-
Here, I will create a basic movie recommender system in Python that uses the correlation between the ratings assigned to different movies, in order to find the similarity between the movies.

## What is a Recommendation System?
A recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing '_system_' with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "_rating_" or "_preference_" a user would give to an item- _Wikipedia_

## Which are some big companies that use Recommender Systems?
* Google
* Youtube
* Facebook
* Netflix
* Spotify
* Amazon
* Reddit
* HackerNews

## Personalized and Non-Personalized Recommendation Systems:
### 1. Personalized Recommendation System-
 * Based on user behavior like purchases
 * Page Views
 * Items added to the cart together

 ### Example of Personalized Recommendation System-

### 2. Non-Personalized Recommendation Systems-
   * Based on their previous history
   * Displays the products that are popular among the people in general during that time frame.

  ### Example of Non-Personalized Recommendation System-

## Examples of Recommender Systems:
##1. Netflix

## Recommendation Based on Intution

## Recommendation can be based on:

### 1. Popularity
* More Buying - More Money
* Eg. Highest Grossing Movies: Avatar, Tianic, etc. People are willing to pay money to watch these movies.

### 2. Popularity Issues
* If I go for a vacation in a new city and I get recommendation of McDonald's which is the most popular resturant.
* I might not like McDonald's as an option, as I would love to try the local food in the given area

## Recommendation Based on Association:

## Example
If I buy an Iphone XR, I get recommendations of of buying an Iphone charger, case, etc.

Another simple approch is being aware of products which are being **bought together** or **the things that go together**.

## How does this work?
### Approach- Apriori algorithm

Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database - _Wikipedia_

You can find my detailed explaination here- [Aprori Algorithm](https://github.com/mitushaa/ShopifyInternshipChallenge2020/wiki/Apriori-Algorithm)<br>

## How to recommend?
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Simple Approch - Just sort by ratings!
### Example
=======
* Simple Approach - Just sort by ratings!
### Example 
>>>>>>> 302a31eb3e9bc1448769e586f1429c240443ea3a
Here Product 1- Philips Upbeat has 404 ratings and Product 2- Philips Sports in has 1853 Ratings
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1517/1*UhXvWR8icmi7Y3vH8vpyJg.png)<br><br>
### Here - Product 1 (4 stars) and  Product 2 (3.5 stars)
* Does this mean Product 1 is better than Product 2 <br>
* The Answer is "NO"<br>
* The key point with this is confidence<br>

## Why use recommendation system ?

If I am doing a business and I show you relevent products which you might like, then there are high chances of the customer buying your product and the business making money
