# Recommender System using Python 
 ## **My Project Description:**
 The goal of my project is to show the capabilities of a Recommendation System.<br>
  
I'll be introducing following things:<br><br>
**1. Recommendation System Using collaborative filtering**<br>
**2. Recommendation System Using Content Based System**<br>
**3. Recommendation System Using Hybrid Recommender**<br>
**4. Context Aware Recommender System**<br>

## Types of Recommender Systems:

## 1. Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems
 ### **User-Based collaborative filtering**- <br> 
   * In user-based collaborative filtering, recommendations are generated by considering the preferences in the user's
   neighborhood. 
   * User-based collaborative filtering is done in two steps:
   * Identify similar users based on similar user preferences.
   * Recommend new items to an active user based on the rating given by similar users on the items not rated by the active user.
 ### **Item-Based collaborative filtering**- <br>
   * In item-based collaborative filtering, the recommendations are generated using the neighbourhood of items.<br>
   * Unlike user-based collaborative filtering, we first find similarities between items and then recommend non-rated items which are        similar to the items the active user has rated in past. 
   * Item-based recommender systems are constructed in two steps:<br>
   * Calculate the item similarity based on the item preferences.
   * Find the top similar items to the non-rated items by active user and recommend them.
 ## 2. Content-Based Recommender Systems
   * A content-based recommender system uses the content information of the items for building the recommendation model.<br>
   * A content recommender system typically contains a user-profile generation step, item profile generation step and model building step to generate recommendations for an active user. 
   * The content-based recommender system recommends items to users by taking the content or features of items and user profiles. 
   * **Example-** If you have searched for videos of Car Racing on YouTube, then the content-based recommender system will learn your preference and recommend other videos related to Car Racing and other videos related to racing.
 ## 3. Hybrid Recommender System
   *  This type of recommendation engine is built by combining various recommender systems to build a more robust system. By combining various recommender systems, we can replace the disadvantages of one system with the advantages of
another system and thus build a more robust system. 
   * For example, by combining collaborative filtering methods, where the model fails when new items don't have ratings, with content-based systems, where feature information about the items is available, new items can be recommended more accurately and efficiently.

## Personalization level of Recommender System:
Recommendations can come at many personalization levels, from using basic statistics
to looking at individual user data.

 
 ### 1. Non-Personalized Recommender Sytem:<br>
  *  __Non-personalized__ recommender system displays the products that are popular among the people in general during that time frame.
   
 ### 2. Personalized Recommender System:<br>
  * __Personalized__ recommender system is based on data about the current user that indicates how the user has interacted with the system previously. This generates recommendations specifically for this user.
 ### 3. Semi-Personalized Recommender System:<br>
 * __Semi-Personalized__ recommender system doesnâ€™t know anything personal about you, only you as
a member of a group or segment. Other people who fit into the same group will get
the same recommendations.

## Implementation of Recommendation System
This is how I first started ðŸ˜ƒ
## 1.  Building the Basic Recommendation System
Here, I will create a basic movie recommender system in Python that uses the correlation between the ratings assigned to different movies, in order to find the similarity between the movies.
